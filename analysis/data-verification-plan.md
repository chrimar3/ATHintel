# Data Verification Plan - Spitogatos URL Validation

## Current Status

**Dataset:** 75 properties with Spitogatos URLs  
**Collected:** August 2025  
**Challenge:** Spitogatos blocks automated URL checking (405 errors)

## Sample URLs for Manual Verification

```
https://www.spitogatos.gr/en/property/1117890847  # Kolonaki apartment ‚Ç¨350K
https://www.spitogatos.gr/en/property/1116349256  # Ilisia apartment ‚Ç¨1.39M  
https://www.spitogatos.gr/en/property/1118007284  # Kipseli apartment 123m¬≤
https://www.spitogatos.gr/en/property/1117447571  # Property #4
https://www.spitogatos.gr/en/property/1117299465  # Property #5
```

## Verification Strategy

### Manual Check Process
1. **Random Sample:** Check 10-15 URLs manually via browser
2. **Status Categories:**
   - ‚úÖ **Active**: Property still listed with matching details
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Changed**: Property exists but details differ
   - ‚ùå **Removed**: Property no longer available
   - üîÑ **Redirected**: URL redirects to different property

### Expected Results
- **Realistic expectation:** 60-80% of URLs still valid after 4-5 months
- **Common issues:** Price changes, property sold, listings expired
- **Pattern analysis:** Which neighborhoods/price ranges have higher survival rates

## Professional Assessment

### Data Quality Claims
- **Original claim:** "100% verified real properties"
- **Reality check:** Scraped data degrades over time
- **Professional standard:** Acknowledge limitations transparently

### Consulting Implications
1. **Use for trend analysis** rather than specific property recommendations
2. **Update disclaimer** about data vintage and verification status
3. **Focus on market patterns** that remain valid even if individual listings change

## Recommendation

**For client presentations:**
- "Based on analysis of 75 verified properties from August 2025"
- "URL verification pending due to anti-scraping measures"
- "Data used for market trend analysis and strategic insights"
- "Individual property status should be re-verified for investment decisions"

## Next Steps

1. Manual verification of 10-15 sample URLs
2. Update analysis with verification results
3. Revise authenticity claims to be professionally accurate
4. Document data limitations for client transparency
