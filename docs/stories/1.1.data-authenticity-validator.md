# Story 1.1: Data Authenticity Validator Implementation

## Status
Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** a comprehensive property data validation system,  
**so that** only authenticated real properties enter our analysis pipeline.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Multi-factor authentication scorer validates properties across 6 dimensions (URL, price, attributes, market, temporal, images)
2. Validation rules are configurable via YAML configuration file
3. Each property receives authenticity score (0-100) with detailed breakdown
4. Rejected properties are logged with specific failure reasons
5. System processes 100+ properties per minute with validation
6. Unit tests cover all validation scenarios with 90% coverage

**Integration Verification:**
- IV1: Existing scrapers continue to function with validation layer added
- IV2: Current JSON data structure remains compatible with new authenticity fields
- IV3: Processing speed degradation less than 20% with validation enabled

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Enhance existing PropertyValidator class (AC: 1, 3)
  - [ ] Implement 6-factor authentication scoring system
  - [ ] Add detailed score breakdown functionality
  - [ ] Integrate with existing validation framework

- [ ] Task 2: Implement YAML configuration system (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Create validation rules configuration schema
  - [ ] Add configuration loading and validation
  - [ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing config

- [ ] Task 3: Add comprehensive logging and reporting (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement detailed failure reason logging
  - [ ] Add rejection tracking and reporting
  - [ ] Integrate with existing logging infrastructure

- [ ] Task 4: Performance optimization (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Profile current validation performance
  - [ ] Optimize for 100+ properties per minute throughput
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

- [ ] Task 5: Testing and Quality Assurance (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Create comprehensive unit test suite
  - [ ] Achieve 90% test coverage
  - [ ] Add integration tests for all validation scenarios

- [ ] Task 6: Integration Verification (IV1, IV2, IV3)
  - [ ] Test compatibility with existing scrapers
  - [ ] Verify JSON schema compatibility
  - [ ] Performance regression testing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the Real Data Transformation Initiative epic. No previous story context available.

### Current Source Structure Context
Based on existing codebase analysis:

- **Existing Validator**: `src/validators/property_validator.py` already exists with basic validation framework
- **Configuration System**: `src/config/` directory contains existing configuration infrastructure
- **Security Framework**: `src/security/input_validator.py` provides validation exceptions and security validation
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Existing logging setup using Python logging module

### Data Models
**No specific architecture documentation found for data models**

From existing code structure:
- ValidationScore dataclass exists for scoring results
- Property validation system already partially implemented
- JSON data structures for property data processing

**[Source: Existing src/validators/property_validator.py analysis]**

### API Specifications
**No specific API architecture documentation found**

From existing integrations:
- Integration with feature flags system (`config/feature_flags`)
- Security validation integration (`security/input_validator`)

### Component Specifications
**No specific component architecture documentation found**

Based on existing structure:
- PropertyValidator class as main validation component
- ValidationScore for scoring results
- Integration with existing config and security systems

### File Locations
Based on existing project structure:
- Main implementation: `src/validators/property_validator.py` (enhance existing)
- Configuration files: `src/config/validation_rules.yaml` (to be created)
- Test files: `tests/validators/test_property_validator.py` (to be created)
- Logging configuration: Utilize existing logging infrastructure

### Testing Requirements
**No specific testing architecture documentation found**

From existing code patterns:
- Use Python unittest framework (evident from existing imports)
- Test files should be located in parallel `tests/` directory structure
- Aim for 90% coverage as specified in acceptance criteria
- Integration tests needed for performance verification

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: Must maintain <20% degradation in processing speed
- **Compatibility**: Must work with existing scrapers and JSON structures
- **Integration**: Must utilize existing config, security, and logging systems
- **Python Version**: Based on existing imports, using Python 3.7+ features

## Testing

### Testing Standards
**No specific testing architecture documentation found**

Based on existing code analysis:
- **Test Framework**: Python unittest (standard library)
- **Test Location**: Create `tests/validators/` directory structure
- **Coverage Target**: 90% as specified in acceptance criteria
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for validation logic, integration tests for performance and compatibility

### Testing Requirements for This Story
- Unit tests for all 6 validation dimensions
- Configuration system testing
- Performance benchmarking tests (100+ properties/minute)
- Integration tests with existing scraper systems
- Failure logging and reporting tests
