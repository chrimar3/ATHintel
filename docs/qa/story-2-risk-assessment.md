# QA RISK ASSESSMENT: Story 2 - "The Price-Energy Pattern Specialist"

## Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Level: HIGH** ðŸ”´

Story 2 presents significant credibility and professional liability risks. While the specific properties cited exist in the dataset, the analysis reveals critical issues with statistical validity, cherry-picking, and misleading correlation claims.

## 1. DATA ACCURACY RISKS

### Line-by-Line Validation

| Claim | Property Details | Validation Status | Risk Level |
|-------|-----------------|-------------------|------------|
| 390sqm Class G @ â‚¬450,000 (â‚¬1,154/sqm) | Property ID: b73238a240e7 | âœ“ EXACT MATCH | LOW |
| 125sqm Class B @ â‚¬550,000 (â‚¬4,400/sqm) | Property ID: bed8d4f0c02b | âœ“ EXACT MATCH | LOW |
| 90sqm Class A @ â‚¬630,000 (â‚¬7,000/sqm) | Property ID: 7e095358aa9a | âœ“ EXACT MATCH | LOW |

**Assessment**: Properties exist as claimed, calculations are accurate.

**Risk**: LOW for data accuracy, but HIGH for representativeness (see below).

---

## 2. STATISTICAL VALIDITY RISKS ðŸš¨

### Critical Findings

#### 2.1 Insufficient Statistical Power
- **Sample Size**: 71 properties with energy data
- **Required for Correlation**: 85 properties (Î±=0.05, power=0.8)
- **Verdict**: INSUFFICIENT DATA for reliable correlation claims

#### 2.2 Weak and Non-Significant Correlation
- **Pearson Correlation**: 0.179
- **P-value**: 0.1364
- **Statistical Significance**: NOT SIGNIFICANT (p > 0.05)
- **Correlation Strength**: WEAK

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Claiming "clear value correlation" when correlation is weak and not statistically significant is professionally negligent.

#### 2.3 Severely Imbalanced Classes
```
Class A+: 1 property  (CRITICALLY INSUFFICIENT)
Class A:  6 properties (INSUFFICIENT)
Class B:  4 properties (INSUFFICIENT)
Class C:  21 properties
Class D:  28 properties
Class E:  5 properties (INSUFFICIENT)
Class F:  3 properties (CRITICALLY INSUFFICIENT)
Class G:  3 properties (CRITICALLY INSUFFICIENT)
```

**Risk**: Classes with <5 samples cannot support statistical conclusions.

## 3. CHERRY-PICKING ANALYSIS ðŸš¨

### Story 2 Examples vs. Reality

| Energy Class | Story 2 Example | Percentile | Median Reality | Assessment |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| Class G | â‚¬1,154/sqm | 33rd | â‚¬1,632/sqm | CHERRY-PICKED (lowest price) |
| Class B | â‚¬4,400/sqm | 75th | â‚¬3,611/sqm | SOMEWHAT SELECTIVE |
| Class A | â‚¬7,000/sqm | 100th | â‚¬3,547/sqm | EXTREME CHERRY-PICK (highest price) |

**Critical Issue**: The Class A example (â‚¬7,000/sqm) is literally the MOST EXPENSIVE Class A property in the entire dataset - a textbook case of cherry-picking.

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** - Easy for clients to discover this manipulation.

---

## 4. COUNTER-EXAMPLES THAT DESTROY THE NARRATIVE

### High-Priced Poor Energy Class Properties
```
Class E: â‚¬9,677/sqm (Exarchia) - HIGHER than Story 2's Class A example!
Class D: â‚¬7,553/sqm (Kolonaki)
Class D: â‚¬7,386/sqm (Kolonaki)
Class D: â‚¬7,117/sqm (Exarchia)
```

### Low-Priced Good Energy Class Properties
```
Class A: â‚¬1,569/sqm (Exarchia) - LOWER than Class G average!
Class B: â‚¬2,692/sqm (Exarchia)
Class A: â‚¬3,212/sqm (Exarchia)
```

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** - These counter-examples completely invalidate the "clear correlation" claim.

---

## 5. CONFOUNDING VARIABLES

### Uncontrolled Factors

1. **Location Effect**: 
   - Kolonaki properties command premium regardless of energy class
   - Neighborhood explains more variance than energy rating

2. **Size Confound**:
   - Class G average: 204.7 sqm (larger properties)
   - Class A+ average: 21.0 sqm (tiny studios)
   - Size correlates inversely with price/sqm

3. **Sample Bias**:
   - Most Class A/B properties in Exarchia (student area)
   - Most Class D in Kolonaki (premium area)

**Risk Level: HIGH** - Failure to control for confounding variables.

---

## 6. PROFESSIONAL LIABILITY RISKS

### Misleading Claims

1. **"Clear value correlation with energy efficiency"**
   - Reality: Correlation is 0.179 (weak) and not significant
   - Liability: False representation of statistical relationship

2. **Implied Causation**
   - Story suggests energy class drives price
   - Reality: Location and size are stronger predictors

3. **Selective Data Presentation**
   - Showing only 3 carefully selected examples
   - Hiding 68 other properties that don't fit narrative

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** - Could constitute professional malpractice.

---

## 7. CLIENT DISCOVERY RISK

### Easy-to-Verify Issues

1. **Client asks**: "Is the â‚¬7,000/sqm Class A typical?"
   - Discovery: It's literally the highest in the dataset
   - Trust Impact: Immediate credibility loss

2. **Client asks**: "Show me all Class A properties"
   - Discovery: 5 of 6 are below â‚¬4,000/sqm
   - Trust Impact: Pattern of deception revealed

3. **Client asks**: "What about that Class E property in Exarchia?"
   - Discovery: â‚¬9,677/sqm despite poor energy rating
   - Trust Impact: Narrative completely collapses

**Risk Level: CRITICAL** - High probability of discovery.

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **REMOVE or COMPLETELY REWRITE Story 2**
   - Current version is professionally indefensible
   - Risk of regulatory/legal action if published

2. **If Keeping Energy Analysis, Requirements**:
   - Use median values, not cherry-picked extremes
   - Show full distribution with quartiles
   - Control for neighborhood and size
   - Add confidence intervals
   - Explicitly state "correlation not causation"

3. **Required Disclaimers**:
   ```
   "Analysis based on limited sample (n=71). Energy ratings show 
   weak correlation (r=0.18, p>0.05) with price that is not 
   statistically significant. Location and property size are 
   stronger price predictors. Individual properties may vary 
   significantly from class averages."
   ```

4. **Alternative Approach**:
   - Focus on energy cost savings rather than property value
   - Present as "potential for improvement" not "clear patterns"
   - Use ranges and distributions, not selected examples

---

## ARCHITECTURAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### Pattern Compliance Issues

1. **Data Integrity Violation**: Cherry-picking violates single source of truth
2. **Statistical Rigor Failure**: Weak analysis undermines analytical framework
3. **Trust Architecture Damage**: Deceptive practices erode system credibility

### Long-term Implications

- **Reputation Risk**: Discovery would damage ATHintel brand
- **Legal Exposure**: Potential liability for investment decisions
- **Technical Debt**: Building on false premises requires future correction
- **Market Position**: Loss of "trusted data provider" positioning

---

## FINAL VERDICT

**DO NOT PROCEED** with Story 2 in current form.

The story presents unacceptable professional, legal, and reputational risks. The "clear correlation" claim is statistically false, the examples are cherry-picked, and counter-examples are easily discoverable.

**Recommended Action**: Complete rewrite focusing on honest data presentation with appropriate statistical caveats, or removal of energy correlation claims entirely.
