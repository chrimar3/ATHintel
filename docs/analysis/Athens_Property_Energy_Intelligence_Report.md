## EU Regulatory Compliance Analysis

### Regulatory Framework
The EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) establishes mandatory minimum energy performance standards:

- **2030 Deadline:** All residential buildings must achieve minimum Class E
- **2033 Deadline:** All residential buildings must achieve minimum Class D
- **Non-Compliance Risk:** Potential restrictions on property sales and rentals

### Compliance Status Breakdown

#### Immediate Compliance (2030)
- **Compliant Properties:** 64 properties (90%)
- **Non-Compliant (Classes F, G):** 6 properties (8%)
- **Assessment Required:** 4 properties (5%)

#### Future Compliance (2033)
- **Currently Compliant:** 32 properties (45%)
- **Must Upgrade:** 39 properties (55%)
- **Assessment Required:** 4 properties (5%)

### Risk Assessment by Timeline

**HIGH RISK (2030 Deadline - 5 years)**
- 6 properties in Classes F/G require immediate attention
- Estimated upgrade investment: ‚Ç¨60,000-150,000 range*
- Government subsidies available through Exoikonomo program

**MEDIUM RISK (2033 Deadline - 8 years)**  
- 28 additional Class D properties require planning
- Longer timeline allows for strategic upgrade scheduling
- Potential for improved subsidy programs

*Cost estimates based on general market rates, specific assessments required
