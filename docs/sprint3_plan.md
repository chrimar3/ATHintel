# Sprint 3 Plan: Production Integration
**Sprint**: 3  
**Duration**: Week 3  
**Theme**: Production Deployment with Realistic Constraints

## ðŸŽ¯ Sprint Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. Deploy validation pipeline to production
2. Implement rate-limited scraping system
3. Integrate with existing real data sources
4. Monitor data quality in production

### Reality Check: Throughput Expectations
- **Scraping Rate**: 500-2,000 properties/hour (realistic)
- **Validation Rate**: 23.6M properties/minute (for batched data)
- **Pipeline Throughput**: Limited by scraping, not validation

## ðŸ“‹ Sprint 3 Backlog

### Story 1.5: Production Pipeline Integration (8 points)
**Objective**: Deploy validation system to production environment

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Integration with existing realdata/ sources
- [ ] Production configuration management  
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Logging and audit trail
- [ ] Health check endpoints

### Story 1.6: Rate-Limited Scraping System (8 points)  
**Objective**: Implement respectful web scraping with rate limits

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Configurable rate limits per domain
- [ ] Request queueing and throttling
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Scraping scheduler for continuous updates
- [ ] Respect robots.txt and rate limits

### Story 1.7: Data Quality Monitoring (5 points)
**Objective**: Monitor and alert on data quality issues

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Quality metrics dashboard
- [ ] Automated quality checks
- [ ] Alert on data anomalies
- [ ] Historical quality trends
- [ ] Quality scoring system

## ðŸ“Š Realistic Performance Targets

### Scraping Targets (per domain/hour):
- **spitogatos.gr**: 500-1,000 properties
- **xe.gr**: 800-1,500 properties  
- **Total**: 1,300-2,500 properties/hour

### Validation Targets:
- **Real-time**: Process scraped data <1 second
- **Batch**: Process historical data at 10M+/minute
- **Quality**: 95% data quality score

### System Reliability:
- **Uptime**: 99.5%
- **Error Rate**: <1%
- **Alert Response**: <5 minutes

- Implement quality monitoring

### Day 4: Monitoring & Alerts
- Set up quality dashboards
- Configure automated alerts
- Add performance monitoring

### Day 5: Testing & Deployment
- End-to-end testing
- Load testing with realistic data
- Production deployment

## ðŸ”§ Technical Architecture

### Production Pipeline:
```
Web Sources â†’ Rate Limiter â†’ Scraper â†’ Validator â†’ Storage
     â†“              â†“           â†“         â†“         â†“

                                      Check
```

### Quality Monitoring:
```

                                   â†“
                              Alert System
```

## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation

### Scraping Risks:
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement exponential backoff
- **IP Blocking**: Rotate user agents, respect limits
- **Site Changes**: Regular adapter updates

### Data Quality Risks:
- **Stale Data**: Automated freshness checks
- **Invalid Data**: Multi-layer validation
- **Missing Data**: Gap detection and alerts

### Production Risks:
- **Downtime**: Health checks and auto-restart
- **Performance**: Resource monitoring
- **Security**: Input validation and sanitization

**Sprint 3 Focus**: Production-ready deployment with realistic performance expectations based on actual web scraping constraints.
