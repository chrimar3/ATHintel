## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- **FR1:** The system SHALL process and analyze ONLY authenticated real property data, rejecting any synthetic or unverified data sources in all analysis pipelines
- **FR2:** All existing reports and dashboards SHALL be regenerated using exclusively real data from the verified datasets (currently 75 properties worth ‚Ç¨27.6M)
- **FR3:** The data validation system SHALL implement multi-factor authentication scoring that verifies property URLs, cross-references market data, and validates price ranges against neighborhood averages
- **FR4:** The repository structure SHALL be reorganized to clearly separate production code (real data) from experimental/testing code, with fakedata moved to a non-production branch or separate repository
- **FR5:** Value assessment algorithms SHALL be enhanced to utilize actual market comparables, historical price trends, and verified neighborhood statistics from real data only
- **FR6:** The system SHALL provide transparent data lineage tracking, showing the source and verification status of every property used in analysis
- **FR7:** Investment reports SHALL include explicit data authenticity statements and confidence scores based on data completeness
- **FR8:** The analytics engine SHALL calculate value scores using only verified property attributes, handling missing data through documented statistical methods rather than synthetic fill-ins
- **FR9:** All data collection scripts SHALL be refactored to focus on quality over quantity, implementing rate limiting and respectful scraping practices
- **FR10:** The system SHALL maintain an audit log of all data authenticity decisions, including rejected properties and reasons for rejection

#### Multi-Factor Authentication Details (FR3)

The multi-factor authentication system implements a comprehensive scoring system across six dimensions:
1. **URL Verification** (Basic): Confirm the property URL actually exists on Spitogatos/XE
2. **Price Consistency** (Advanced): Compare listed price against neighborhood averages to detect outliers
3. **Attribute Validation** (Advanced): Check if property size, rooms, and features align with typical patterns
4. **Market Cross-Reference** (Advanced): Verify similar properties exist in the area with comparable pricing
5. **Temporal Validation** (Advanced): Ensure listing dates are recent and property hasn't been delisted
6. **Image Analysis** (Optional): Verify property images are unique and not stock photos

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1:** Data processing performance SHALL maintain or improve current speeds despite additional authentication checks (current: ~100 properties/minute analysis)
- **NFR2:** The system SHALL achieve 99.9% data authenticity accuracy, with false positives (fake data marked as real) below 0.1%
- **NFR3:** Repository reorganization SHALL follow Python best practices with clear separation of concerns, maintaining backwards compatibility for existing API integrations
- **NFR4:** All code changes SHALL maintain existing test coverage (if tests exist) and add new tests for authenticity verification functions
- **NFR5:** The enhanced value assessment SHALL provide confidence intervals for all projections, with documented margin of error based on data completeness
- **NFR6:** System documentation SHALL be updated to reflect new data-authenticity-first architecture within the same sprint as code changes
- **NFR7:** Data storage SHALL be optimized to reduce redundancy while maintaining data integrity, targeting 30% reduction in storage footprint
- **NFR8:** The refactored system SHALL support incremental data updates without full dataset regeneration, enabling daily market updates

### 2.3 Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1:** Existing Python analytics modules (market_segmentation.py, monte_carlo_modeling.py) SHALL continue functioning with minimal interface changes
- **CR2:** Current JSON data schema SHALL be preserved or provide automated migration tools for existing datasets
- **CR3:** Report generation templates SHALL maintain current structure while adding authenticity indicators
- **CR4:** Integration with Spitogatos and XE scrapers SHALL be preserved while adding enhanced validation layers

## 3. Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### 3.1 Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: Python 3.x (primary), Bash scripting  
**Frameworks**: CrewAI (agents), Crawlee (scraping), Custom analytics engines  
**Database**: JSON file-based storage (datasets/*.json)  
**Infrastructure**: Local execution, file-system based  
**External Dependencies**: Spitogatos API, XE property portal, Statistical libraries (scipy, numpy, pandas implied)

### 3.2 Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**: Maintain JSON-based storage but implement versioned data schemas with migration scripts. Add SQLite for data lineage tracking and audit logs while keeping JSON for property data to maintain compatibility.

**API Integration Strategy**: Enhance existing Spitogatos/XE scrapers with validation middleware layer. Implement circuit breakers and retry logic with exponential backoff. Add new data authenticity API endpoints for internal validation checks.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**: Currently CLI/script-based - maintain this approach but add data authenticity indicators in all output. Future consideration for web dashboard with authenticity visualization.

**Testing Integration Strategy**: Implement pytest-based test suite for authenticity validation. Create separate test datasets with known-fake properties for validation testing. Maintain test coverage for all refactored components.

### 3.3 Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**: 
- Move all production code to `src/` with clear module separation
- Relocate `fakedata/` to `test/fixtures/` or remove entirely
- Create `src/validators/` for authenticity checking modules
- Establish `src/production/` for verified data processing only

**Naming Conventions**: 
- Prefix authenticity-related modules with `verified_` or `authentic_`
- Use `_real` suffix for production data processors
- Clear separation: `scraper_` for collection, `validator_` for verification, `analyzer_` for processing

**Coding Standards**: 
- Type hints for all new functions
- Docstrings with authenticity parameters documented
- Max line length 100 characters
- Error handling for all external data sources

**Documentation Standards**: 
- Each module must document its data authenticity requirements
- README files in each major directory
- Inline comments for authenticity scoring algorithms

### 3.4 Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**: Create Makefile or setup.py for environment setup. Add pre-commit hooks for code quality checks. Implement automated authenticity validation in CI pipeline.

**Deployment Strategy**: Package as installable Python module. Docker containerization for consistent environments. Environment variables for API keys and scraping limits.

**Monitoring and Logging**: Structured logging with authenticity scores for every property. Daily reports on data quality metrics. Alert system for authenticity score degradation.

**Configuration Management**: YAML-based configuration for validation thresholds. Separate configs for production vs development. Feature flags for gradual rollout of enhanced validation.

### 3.5 Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks**: 
- Scraper blocking due to increased validation requests
- Performance degradation from multi-factor authentication
- Data loss during repository reorganization
- Breaking changes to existing analytics pipelines

**Integration Risks**: 
- Spitogatos/XE API changes breaking validation
- Incompatibility between old and new data formats
- Loss of historical synthetic data used for testing
- Dependency conflicts during refactoring

**Deployment Risks**: 
- Production data corruption during migration
- Incomplete data authenticity causing analysis failures
- User confusion during transition period
- Loss of existing functionality during refactor

**Mitigation Strategies**: 
- Implement gradual rollout with feature flags
- Maintain parallel old/new systems during transition
- Comprehensive backup before any data migration
- Extensive testing with production data copies
- Rollback procedures for each story
- Clear communication about changes in reports

## 4. Epic and Story Structure

### 4.1 Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic titled "Real Data Transformation Initiative" 

**Rationale**: All enhancement aspects (data validation, repository reorganization, algorithm updates, report regeneration) are tightly coupled around the central theme of data authenticity. Breaking into multiple epics would create dependencies and coordination overhead without clear value boundaries.
