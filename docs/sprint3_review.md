## 🔍 Technical Architecture

### Production Stack:
```
Web Sources → Rate Limiter → Scraper → Pipeline → Validator
     ↓              ↓           ↓         ↓         ↓
  robots.txt    Queue/Delay   Parse   Quality   Database
                                      Monitor
```

### Data Flow:
1. **Scraping**: Rate-limited data collection
2. **Pipeline**: Batch processing and validation  
3. **Quality**: Continuous monitoring and alerting
4. **Storage**: Audit trail and historical analysis

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Import Path Issues**
   - Issue: Relative imports beyond top-level package
   - Resolution: Converted to absolute imports

2. **urllib.parse Import Error**
   - Issue: Cannot import 'robots' from urllib.parse
   - Resolution: Removed unused import, use urllib.robotparser

3. **Performance vs Reality**
   - Issue: 23.6M/min validation vs scraping constraints
   - Clarification: Validation is batch processing, scraping is rate-limited
