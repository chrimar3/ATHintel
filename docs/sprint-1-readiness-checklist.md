## 🎯 Sprint 1 Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Story 1.1 Complete** - Data validator operational
2. **Story 1.2 Complete** - Repository reorganized
3. **90% Test Coverage** - For Story 1.1
4. **Zero Regression** - No existing functionality broken

### Stretch Goals
- 95% test coverage for Story 1.1
- Automated migration for Story 1.2
- Performance optimization implemented
- Documentation fully updated

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Story Completion | 2/2 | Stories marked done |
| Test Coverage | 85% average | pytest-cov report |
| Bug Count | <10 open | GitHub issues |
| Performance | <20% degradation | Baseline comparison |
| Feature Flags | All working | Validation script |

---

## 🚨 Risk Assessment

### Identified Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| QA resources unavailable | Medium | High | PM can execute test plans |
| Import path issues (1.2) | High | Medium | Extensive testing planned |
| Performance degradation (1.1) | Medium | High | Feature flags for rollback |
| Git history loss (1.2) | Low | High | Use git mv exclusively |

### Contingency Plans
1. **If QA unavailable:** Developers write and execute tests
2. **If performance degrades:** Disable validation via flags
3. **If migration fails:** Rollback script ready
4. **If bugs exceed threshold:** Extend sprint by 3 days
