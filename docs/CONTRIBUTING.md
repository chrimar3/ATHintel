## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python 3.8 or higher
python --version

# Git for version control
git --version
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chrimar3/ATHintel.git
cd ATHintel

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r config/requirements.txt

# Run tests to verify setup
python -m pytest tests/
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Include type hints where appropriate
- Limit line length to 88 characters (Black formatter)

### Example Function Format
```python
def analyze_investment_opportunity(
    property_data: Dict[str, Any], 
    confidence_level: float = 0.95
) -> InvestmentOpportunity:
    """
    Analyze a single property for investment potential.
    
    Args:
        property_data: Dictionary containing property information
        confidence_level: Statistical confidence level (default: 0.95)
    
    Returns:
        InvestmentOpportunity object with complete analysis
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If required fields are missing from property_data
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

### ML Model Guidelines
- Document all model assumptions and limitations
- Include model validation and performance metrics
- Provide clear explanations of feature engineering
- Use cross-validation for model evaluation

## üîç Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_intelligence_engine.py

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=. tests/
```

### Writing Tests
- Test all public functions and methods
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Mock external dependencies (web scraping, databases)

### Example Test
```python
def test_investment_score_calculation():
    """Test investment score calculation with known data."""
    # Arrange
    test_property = {
        'neighborhood': 'ŒöŒøŒªœâŒΩŒ¨Œ∫Œπ',
        'price': 500000,
        'sqm': 100,
        'energy_class': 'B+'
    }
    
    # Act
    score = calculate_investment_score(test_property)
    
    # Assert
    assert 1.0 <= score <= 10.0
    assert isinstance(score, float)
```

## üìä Data Contribution Guidelines

### Data Quality Standards
- **Authenticity**: All data must be from real, verifiable sources
- **Completeness**: Core fields (price, sqm, energy_class) must be present
- **Accuracy**: Data should reflect current market conditions
- **Provenance**: Include source URL and extraction timestamp

### Adding New Data Sources
1. Document the source (platform, URL, access method)
2. Create extraction script following existing patterns
3. Implement validation for data quality
4. Add tests for the new data pipeline
5. Update documentation with new source details

### Data Privacy
- No personal information (owner names, contact details)
- Aggregate data only for public analysis
- Respect platform terms of service
- Follow ethical scraping practices

## üß† ML Model Contributions

### Model Development Guidelines
- Use appropriate validation techniques (cross-validation, holdout sets)
- Document feature selection and engineering processes
- Include model performance metrics and comparisons
- Provide interpretability analysis for investment decisions

### Model Integration
- Follow existing model interface patterns
- Include comprehensive unit tests
- Document model parameters and hypertuning
- Provide example usage and expected outputs
