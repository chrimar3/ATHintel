- Circuit breaker pattern prevents CPU waste on failing services
- Performance optimizer monitors CPU utilization automatically

**Bottlenecks Identified:**
```python
# In health_system.py - Line 448: CPU monitoring
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)  # Blocking 1-second interval
```
**Impact:** 1-second blocking call in health monitoring loop  
**Fix:** Use non-blocking CPU sampling with rolling averages

```python
# In performance_optimizer.py - Line 196: Synchronous CPU collection
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)
```
**Impact:** Performance monitoring itself creates CPU overhead

## 🚨 Critical Bottlenecks & Solutions

### 1. Health Check Performance Impact

**Issue:** Health checks run every 30 seconds with 1-second blocking CPU calls
```python
# Performance impact calculation:
# 1 second CPU check + network calls = ~2 seconds per health check cycle
# Impact: 6.7% overhead (2s/30s) on monitoring thread
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Implement non-blocking health checks
class OptimizedHealthCheck:
    async def execute(self):
        # Use cached CPU values with 5-second refresh
        cpu_percent = await self._get_cached_cpu_percent()
        # Parallel execution of health checks
        tasks = [check.execute() for check in self.checks]
        results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```

### 2. Backup I/O Bottleneck

**Issue:** Large backup operations block other I/O operations
```python
# Current backup blocking estimate:
# 1GB database dump = ~30 seconds with compression
# File system backup = ~60 seconds for full application
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Implement I/O throttling and background processing
class ThrottledBackupManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.io_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(2)  # Limit concurrent I/O
        self.backup_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        
    async def throttled_backup(self):
        async with self.io_semaphore:
            # Implement chunked I/O with yields
            await self._chunked_backup_with_yields()
```

### 3. Dashboard Query Performance

**Issue:** Complex dashboard queries may impact user response times
```python
# Dashboard data aggregation bottleneck:
# Portfolio overview requires multiple database queries
# Market comparison needs statistical calculations
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Implement query optimization and caching
class OptimizedDashboardService:
    async def get_portfolio_overview(self, user_id: str):
        # Use materialized views for expensive aggregations
        # Implement query result caching with smart invalidation
        # Parallel execution of independent queries
        tasks = [
            self._get_cached_portfolio_metrics(user_id),
            self._get_cached_market_data(),
            self._get_cached_benchmarks(user_id)
        ]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

### 4. Memory Usage in Metrics Collection

**Issue:** Prometheus metrics collection grows unbounded without proper management
```python
# Memory growth pattern:
# 50+ metrics * 10 labels per metric * historical data = significant memory usage
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Implement metrics aggregation and cleanup
class OptimizedMetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics_buffer = collections.deque(maxlen=1000)
        self.cleanup_interval = 300  # 5 minutes
        
    async def cleanup_old_metrics(self):
        # Aggregate old metrics into time-based buckets
        # Remove detailed data older than 1 hour
        # Keep summary statistics for historical analysis
```

               return value
           # Check L2 cache
           if value := await self.redis_client.get(key):
               self.l1_cache.set(key, value, ttl=60)
