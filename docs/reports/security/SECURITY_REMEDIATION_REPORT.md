**Impact:** High - Data exposure risk  
**Resolution:**
- Added SQLCipher encryption framework support
- Implemented environment-based encryption key management
- Added secure database backup functionality
- Enhanced connection security with additional PRAGMA settings
- Added encryption status monitoring and validation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/security/secure_database.py` (Enhanced)

### 6. ‚úÖ HTTP Security Headers & HTTPS Enforcement
**Issue:** Missing security headers and no HTTPS enforcement  
**Impact:** Medium-High - Various attack vectors  
**Resolution:**
- Added comprehensive `SecurityHeadersMiddleware`
- Implemented OWASP-recommended security headers
- Added HTTPS enforcement in production environments
- Implemented Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Added proper CORS configuration with origin validation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/api/secure_energy_endpoints.py` (Enhanced)

- Implemented structured error responses
- Added comprehensive exception handling for all security components

### Request Validation
- Added content-type validation for POST requests
- Implemented proper HTTP method restrictions
- Enhanced request ID generation and tracking

### Configuration Validation
- Added production environment validation
- Implemented secure default configurations
- Added configuration health checks
