## üî¥ Critical Decision Points

### 1. **Fake Data Elimination**
**Question:** Complete removal vs. separate test repository?  
**Recommendation:** Move to test/fixtures for testing only  
**Impact:** Cleaner production, maintained testing capability

### 2. **Validation Strictness**
**Question:** How strict should authentication be?  
**Current Proposal:** 99.9% accuracy target  
**Trade-off:** May reject some legitimate properties initially

### 3. **Performance vs. Quality**
**Question:** Accept 20% performance degradation for validation?  
**Current Proposal:** Yes, quality over speed  
**Alternative:** Async validation for non-critical paths

### 4. **Repository Structure**
**Question:** Full reorganization or incremental?  
**Current Proposal:** Full reorg in Story 1.2  
**Risk:** Import path changes across codebase

### 5. **Parallel Development**
**Question:** Allow parallel work on Stories 1.2 and 1.6?  
**Benefit:** Faster delivery  
**Risk:** Integration complexity

## üí¨ Key Discussion Topics

### Technical Debt
- **Current:** 94.7% properties missing floor data
- **Approach:** Statistical estimation with confidence intervals
- **Question:** Acceptable for investment decisions?

### Data Sources
- **Current:** Spitogatos + XE scrapers
- **Enhancement:** Add validation middleware
- **Question:** Risk of API blocking with increased requests?

### Testing Strategy  
- **Challenge:** How to test with real-data-only?
- **Proposal:** Known-fake test fixtures
- **Question:** Sufficient for comprehensive testing?

### Migration Approach
- **Proposal:** Feature flags for gradual rollout
- **Alternative:** Big-bang migration
- **Question:** Team preference?
