üèóÔ∏è CQRS Infrastructure Package

Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) implementation for the energy domain.
Provides separation between write operations (commands) and read operations (queries).

Key Components:
- Commands: Write operations that change system state
- Queries: Read operations that retrieve data without side effects
- Command Bus: Routes and executes commands with middleware support
- Query Bus: Routes and executes queries with caching and optimization
- Event Integration: Domain events published from command handlers

Usage:
    from infrastructure.cqrs import get_command_bus, get_query_bus
    from infrastructure.cqrs.commands import AssessPropertyEnergyCommand
    from infrastructure.cqrs.queries import GetPropertyEnergyAssessmentQuery
    
    # Execute command
    command_bus = get_command_bus()
    command = AssessPropertyEnergyCommand(...)
    result = await command_bus.execute(command)
    
    # Execute query
    query_bus = get_query_bus()
    query = GetPropertyEnergyAssessmentQuery(...)
    result = await query_bus.execute(query)
