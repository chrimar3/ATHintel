# 🎭 FakeData - Synthetic & Generated Property Data

**This folder contains ALL synthetic, generated, scaled, and non-authentic property data.**

⚠️ **WARNING**: This folder contains NO real property data. All content is synthetic, generated, or artificially created for testing/experimental purposes.

📍 **Note**: Current focus is on **verified Kolonaki-Exarchia district data** in `/districts/` and `/data/verified-properties/`

## 🎯 Purpose

This folder serves to clearly separate non-authentic data from the verified real data in `realdata/`. It contains:
- Generated/synthetic properties
- Scaled datasets (artificially multiplied)
- Template-based property data
- Experimental and test datasets
- Old data before authenticity verification

## 🚫 Data Quality Warning

❌ **Not for Investment**: Do not use this data for actual investment decisions  
❌ **No Real URLs**: Property URLs may be invalid or non-existent  
❌ **Artificial Pricing**: Prices may not reflect actual market conditions  
❌ **Template Properties**: Many properties generated from templates  
❌ **No Verification**: Data has not been validated against real sources

## 🔍 What's Inside Each Folder

### 📊 generated/
Contains properties created algorithmically:
- Computer-generated property descriptions
- Artificial pricing models
- Procedurally created property features
- Non-validated property locations

### 📈 scaled/
Contains artificially multiplied datasets:
- Original small datasets expanded to 1000+ properties
- Pattern-repeated property data  
- Mathematically scaled property features
- Bulk-generated property variations

### 🏗️ synthetic/
Contains template-based properties:
- Properties created from templates
- Pattern-based property generation
- Standardized synthetic property formats
- Test data for development purposes

### 🗄️ archive/
Contains old experimental data:
- Deprecated datasets
- Old analysis before authenticity verification
- Historical experimental results
- Superseded data collection attempts

## ⚙️ Technical Purpose

This data may be useful for:
- 🧪 **Testing**: Software development and testing
- 📊 **Modeling**: Algorithm development and validation
- 🎓 **Learning**: Understanding data structures and formats
- 🔬 **Research**: Comparative analysis methodologies

## 🚀 Authentic Data Alternative

For real investment analysis and authentic property data, use:
- **`../realdata/`** - Contains 75 verified authentic Athens properties
- **Total real value**: €27,573,256
- **100% verified URLs**: All link to real Spitogatos.gr listings
- **Professional analysis**: Investment reports based on real data

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

**This folder contains NO authentic property data.** All content is synthetic, generated, or artificially created. Do not use for actual investment decisions or market analysis.

For authentic Athens real estate data, always refer to the `realdata/` folder.
