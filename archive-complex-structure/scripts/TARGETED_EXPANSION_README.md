# 🎯 TARGETED EXPANSION COLLECTOR

## Problem Solved
- **Random ID generation**: 0% success rate in production batches
- **Solution**: Use our 203 successful properties as seeds for targeted expansion
- **Expected improvement**: 15-25% success rate vs 0% with random approach

## How It Works

### 1. Seed-Based Foundation
- Loads 203 authenticated successful properties from your dataset
- Extracts property IDs from URLs (e.g., `1117828519` from `https://www.spitogatos.gr/en/property/1117828519`)
- Analyzes ID distribution and clustering patterns

### 2. Expansion Strategies

#### Sequential Expansion (60% of batch)
- Scans ±50, ±100, ±200, ±500 IDs around each successful seed
- Higher probability of finding properties near known successes

#### Cluster Expansion (25% of batch) 
- Focuses on high-density ranges (e.g., 1117M range with 131 successes)
- Generates IDs within successful cluster boundaries

#### Gap Filling (15% of batch)
- Targets gaps between consecutive successful IDs
- Fills smaller gaps first (higher probability areas)

### 3. Success Tracking
- Tracks performance per seed ID
- Monitors success rate by distance from seed
- Analyzes which expansion strategies work best
- Adapts targeting based on real-time results

## Key Features

### Production-Grade Components
- ✅ **Proven batch size**: 10 properties (optimal from testing)
- ✅ **Rate limiting**: 2.0s intervals (proven sustainable)
- ✅ **Validation**: Same standards as successful dataset
